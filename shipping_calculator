/* You are working on a eCommerce website and need to make a shipping cost calculator based on the order amount.
The store uses the following cost structure:
For orders in the US:
- $75+ orders have free shipping
- orders less than $75 have a shipping fee of 10% of the total order amount.

For international orders, there is a 15% shipping fee, with a maximum of $50. This means that the maximum shipping fee for an international order is $50.

You need to complete the given shippingCost() function, which takes the order amount and a Boolean indicating whether the order is international or not, 
and returns the shipping cost for that order.The return amount should be a Double.*/

fun shippingCost(amount: Double, international: Boolean): Double {
    if (international == false ){
        if (amount >= 75) {
            return(0.0)
        }
        else {
            return (amount*0.1)
        }
    }
    else {
        if (amount >= 333.33){
            return (50.0)
        }
        else {
            return (amount*0.15)
        }
    }
}
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val total = readLine()!!.toDouble()
    val international = readLine()!!.toBoolean()    
    println(shippingCost(total, international))
}
